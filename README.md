# Process Management in Distributed Systems: A C++ Approach
## Developed by Jaume Mora for PRO2 subject

### Overview 📘
This project implements a simulation system for process management in an operating system environment, designed using C++. It features multiple components like Processors, Processes, Clusters, and Priority Management, which simulate the complex interactions and scheduling within a system.

### Components 🧩
- **Processador (Processor)**: Manages the execution and scheduling of processes.
- **Proces (Process)**: Represents an individual process with attributes and methods to simulate its behavior.
- **Cluster**: Simulates a collection of processors working together.
- **AreaEspera (Waiting Area)**: Manages processes that are waiting for execution.
- **Prioritat (Priority)**: Handles the priority levels of processes within the system.

### Execution 🚀
To compile and run the simulation:
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `make` to compile the project using the provided Makefile.
4. Execute the compiled program.

### Documentation 📄
The project includes detailed HTML documentation generated via Doxygen, available in the `html` directory and compressed in `html.zip`.

### Conclusion 📝
This project showcases the application of object-oriented programming principles in system simulation, providing a robust framework for understanding process management in an OS context.
