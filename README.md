# Process Management in Distributed Systems: A C++ Approach

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive C++ simulation of process management in distributed systems. It includes implementation of various classes like `Proces`, `Cluster`, `Processador`, and management of waiting areas and priorities within computational systems.

## Features
- **Process Management**: Simulate the creation, execution, and scheduling of processes in a distributed environment.
- **Cluster Simulation**: Manage a cluster of computational resources, allowing for detailed simulation of distributed computing scenarios.
- **Priority Handling**: Implements a priority-based system for managing process execution order.
- **Waiting Area**: Simulate areas for processes waiting for execution or resource allocation.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- Make

### Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [URL_to_Repository]
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd [Project_Directory]
```
Compile the project using Make:
```bash
make all
```

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute:
```bash
./[Executable_Name]
```
Replace `[Executable_Name]` with the name of the created executable file.
